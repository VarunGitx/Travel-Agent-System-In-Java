# Travel-Agent-System-In-Java
This repository contains the code for a Travel Agent System, which is a system for a travel agency that uses a graph library to represent airline data and supports searching based on criteria set by the travel agent. The system allows inputs from the user and provides outputs in an appropriate format.

# Coursework Overview
The coursework aims to reinforce understanding of graph classes, object-oriented software engineering, generic code, and Java programming. The coursework is divided into three parts:

<h2>Part A: Representing direct flights and Cheapest connections </h2>
In this part, the program represents direct flights with associated costs as a graph using the JGraphT library. It then allows users to search for the cheapest journey between two cities consisting of one or more direct flights.

<h2>Part B: Use provided flights dataset, add flight information</h2>
This part involves building a flight graph using a provided flights dataset and adding additional flight information such as flight numbers, departure times, arrival times, durations, and ticket prices. The program then finds and prints the cheapest journey in a specific format.

<h2>Part C: Advanced features</h2>
In this part, the program extends its functionality by implementing advanced features such as calculating total journey duration, finding journeys with the fewest number of changeovers, calculating directly connected airports, performing meet-up searches, and implementing an AirMiles scheme.
